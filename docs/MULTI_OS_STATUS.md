## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed**:
- Multi-OS detection and support across all recipe templates
- Dynamic package manager selection and dependency installation
- Enhanced error handling and retry mechanisms
- Comprehensive network connectivity testing
- Public repository integration for direct downloads

✅ **Validated**:
- Master script (virtualizor-server-setup.sh) works reliably across distributions
